### Purpose ###

This repository contains several simple code snippets for demonstration purpose.


### Folder Structure ###

* C++
    * *C++ examples (including Boost library).*

* Architecture
    * *Architecture-specific examples (Intel SSE...).*

* Windows
    * *Windows programming examples (Windows API, COM, Hook...).*

* Others
    * *Other examples that doesn't fit to any above folders.*

### How do I run examples? ###

Almost all examples here are single file example so you can create a project on your own computer, paste the source code, and run.

Some examples in C++ folder require C++11 or even C++14 compliant compiler, in that case, you can use the following compilers.
